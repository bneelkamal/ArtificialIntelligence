Consider a simple N-Queens problem. Take a suitable value of N and write a Python code for simulated annealing to solve the problem. 
As we know, if we take T=0 in SA, it falls back to simple hill climbing search. Modify the SA algorithm in order to make it an HC solution. 
Theoretical justification in support of modification (e.g., calculation of the acceptance probability) and the behavioral difference between the two approaches.

We‚Äôll use
ùëÅ = 8 and implement Simulated Annealing (SA), then modify it to Hill Climbing (HC).
